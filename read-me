sudo apt-get install arp-scan
----------------------------------------

[ TO RUN ]
cd into directory and:

	sudo python nick-a-Sniffer.py
----------------------------------------

[ TO DO ]
1. I had to put the absolute filepath in the python file when using subprocess for this to work for me.
   
	Make sure to change this path to suit yours.

	eg......row = subprocess.check_output(["/home/andy/Desktop/nick-a-Sniffer/arpSCAN.sh"])

2. You have to manually edit identifiedMACS.txt and the identifiedDB.txt files,
   identifiedDB.txt file is just for display and identifiedMACS.txt is used for comparing macks.

3. chmod u+x arpSCAN.sh

4. chmod u+x nick-a-Sniffer.py if you wish

This program is tailored to python2. You could make this work in python3 if you wish.
Just have to do a bit of tinkering.

I have another version of this in python using scapy and neighbourhood.py which works fine on
Linux Mint 17.2

I also have a non GUI bash version on github which is more interactive.
